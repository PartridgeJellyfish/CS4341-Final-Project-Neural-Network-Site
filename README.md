# Neural Network Builder
## Can Alper, Corey Dixon, Ada Dogrucu
### Proposal:
We made a neural network builder which allows the user to place neurons and link them together in order to create interesting topologies. Snap.svg was used to create a display, display the neurons, and to interact with the neurons in order to move them and link them together. The user is able to save them on the server and download them in a file format for the neural network implementation found at [href="https://github.com/calper95/IneptNN](https://github.com/calper95/IneptNN)
