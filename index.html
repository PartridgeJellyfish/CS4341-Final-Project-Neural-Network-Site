    <h3>Proposal: </h3>
    <p>
      We plan to make a neural network builder which allows the user to place neurons and link them together in order to create interesting topologies. HTML5 will be used to create a canvas and display the neurons while javascript will be used to interact with the neurons in order to move them and link them together. The user will be able to save them on the server and download them in a file format for the neural network implementation found at <a href="https://github.com/calper95/IneptNN">https://github.com/calper95/IneptNN.</a>
